We created three notebooks where we explain detailedly each step of how we solved an end to end deep learning problem. There are three notebooks, one for each model:
- MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)

The three notebooks are self contained, self explanatory and each one can be independently used.
