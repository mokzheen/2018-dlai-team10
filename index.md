# 1. Introduction 

We conceived this project as a way to deeply understand the concepts and implementations of various Deep Learning models studied in the course, for the majority of us are new to this fascinating world of Deep Learning. Towards this goal, we have resolved a classification task that has allowed us to comprehend and perform all the steps of the pipeline of a Deep Learning project. 

Having said that, the technical goal of our project is to implement **from scratch** three different Deep Learning architectures of increasing difficulty (Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory) that tackled in a different way a classification problem extracted from an ongoing Kaggle competition, and create for each model a self-contained and detailed Notebook that alternates text with code. 

# 2. Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge

The idea and the dataset of our project is extracted from [Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition).

Quick, Draw! is a game that was created in 2016 to educate the public in a playful way about how AI works. The basic idea of the game is that it tells the player a simple concept (such as banana, apple...) and he/she has to draw it in a certain amount of time. While the player is drawing, the AI tries to guess what is being drawn. Sometimes it fails because the user does not know the concept he has to draw, or he/she is not able to complete it on time or just because the AI has not generalized well. Nonetheless, it is amazing how acccurate it is!

All the drawings of all the users of the game are stored by Google, so a nice enormous dataset is available for this competition. However, since the training data comes from the game itself, drawings can be incomplete or may not match the label. The challenge consists on building a recognizer that can effectively learn from this **very noisy data** and perform well on a manually-labeled test set from a different distribution.

It is important to note that our goal never was to reach a competitive position in the leaderboard of the competition (*we wish we could, as the prize is of 25.000$)*, but to learn. Therefore, we did not follow strictly the competition indications (we just used a few classes, we used a different result measuring than the proposed...). 


# 3. The Dataset

The dataset that we used is the [Quick, Draw!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition) Dataset. This dataset is extracted from the Kaggle competition Quick Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge.  

This dataset contains drawing of multiple daily objects in **different formats**. This variety in the data was what caught our attention from the very first moment, since we could try different models considering every format of the input data.

The format in which the drawings are provided is either an image with the final drawing or the drawn pixels ordered in time. In fact, Google, who is the datset provider, also provided the simplified datasets, which are a simplified version of the images and simplified versions of the drawing sequences. 

In our project, **we used this simplified versions of the data**. In addition, another simplification that we made was to drastically **reduce the number of classes**. Out of more than 300 classes that were in the original dataset, **we only retained 10** to simplify the classification problem. The selected classes are: 

***Apple, Banana, Book, Fork, Key, Ladder, Pizza, Stop Sign, Tennis Racquet, Wheel***

![clases](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50059288-43b93480-0185-11e9-8d9f-76695e781a8b.JPG) 

The data formats that we used to train our models are the following ones:
- **Grayscale 28x28 images** of the drawings

![apple](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50060779-7f112e80-0198-11e9-903c-798806f9557e.JPG)

- **Flat representations of the grayscale images** in vectors of length 28x28 = 784

- **Sequences with the key pixels** (m, n) representing an object in the order they were drawn. For example, one sequence could be: 
(63, 77), (103, 89), (148, 79), (204, 91), â€¦ This may seem just a sequence, but if we draw these points through the time we obtain a shape like:

![apple_only_points](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29488113/50060968-53dc0e80-019b-11e9-8865-5fd7859b7b4e.png)

## NOISY DATA 
Since this dataset was created by gathering drawings from people in an unsupervised way, there are few drawings that are very noisy and do not represent the object class. We show an example of what is supposed to be a tennis racquet:

![noisydata](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50060771-5be67f00-0198-11e9-97ff-4678e758dab2.JPG)

Moreover, the drawings can be incomplete, resulting in a more challenging classification task.

## Data organization

We split our data into 3 different parts, training, validation and test.

![datapercentage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50059472-8a0f9300-0187-11e9-8ef4-8173e1488041.JPG)




# 4. Models
We decided to evaluate three different approaches of increasing difficulty and performance: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Nerual Network (RNN). 

For the first two approaches (MLP and CNN) we used the simplified dataset, in which the simplified drawings have been rendered into a 28x28 grayscale bitmap in numpy .npy format. While for the RNN, [...]

## 4.1 Multilayer Perceptron

To start, the first model to evaluate was a MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). It uses a supervised learning technique (backpropagation) to train a Neural Network. It can be distinguish from the liner perceptron because it uses multiple hidden layers:

![mlp layer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10107933/50059826-1a4fd700-018c-11e9-8cae-279a28b2a5ef.JPG)

A ReLU Activation function and a Cross-Entropy Loss function have been used.

![loss function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10107933/50059922-75ce9480-018d-11e9-98ff-0d0d729c3380.JPG)


A partciular MLP architectures have been evaluated to find the better performance. 

![models table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10107933/50060014-85021200-018e-11e9-95d4-7268a5ce88c3.JPG)

First, we create a basic model with only three layers, and evaluate the dataset. Later on, we increase the complexity of the network trying to obtain a better performance.


We collect all the results for a better comparison:

![loss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10107933/50060253-fa231680-0191-11e9-8718-8fcd8cc05ca7.JPG)


![accuracy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10107933/50060309-9cdb9500-0192-11e9-8dc6-4b7059623b0e.JPG)

With this architectures, the best accuracy we obtained was 85.3% in the **Model 4**, however it could clearly be seen that the network was overfit.
To prevent this, we decided to implement a loss regularization by adding a new parameter in the cross-entropy loss (weight_decay)

![overfiting_formula](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10107933/50060387-7c600a80-0193-11e9-8955-5747c5705d66.JPG)

The regularization does not provide the desired results, but it does improve the previous results a little bit

![overfiting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10107933/50060611-13c65d00-0196-11e9-87a6-331eb31168c0.JPG)


## 4.2 Convolutional Neural Network

Our motivation to tackle this problem of image classification using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is quite obvious, because it is a specialized kind of neural network for processing data that has a known grid-like topology that leverages the ideas of local connectivity, parameter sharing and pooling/subsampling hidden units. *The basic idea behind a CNN is that the network learns hierarchical representations of the data with increasing levels of abstraction.*

We started creating the following basic CNN architecture and testing how it performed but, as it was very shallow it gave very poor results. In fact, most of the times it got stuck very soon in a local minimum, so the results were awful. 

![arquitecturacnn1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50046296-bcdf5b80-00a1-11e9-8afe-7441718d35d3.JPG) 

With the purpose of improving the performance of the CNN, we deepened the network, so the probability of finding a *bad* local minimum decreased. We came up with the following structure that resulted to be excellent in terms of performance. This final architecture, which will be followingly explained, consists basically on alternating 5 convolutional layers (followed by a non-linearity and a batch normalization layer) with 2 max-pooling layers and, ending with 3 fully connected layers also followed by non-linearity. 

![arquitecturacnn3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50046302-c963b400-00a1-11e9-90e4-769db06d6ec9.JPG)

The **Convolutional Layers** transform 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations performing convolutions on a 2D grid. For the final architecture we have used 5 convolutional with a kernel size of 3x3 and of stride=1 each. They differ in the number of filters though, passing from 6 filters in the first layers to 16 and ending with 32 filters. These last characteristics (filter spatial extent, stride and number of filters) have been set as hyperparameters, which means that they their value is the one that has proven to give a better performance to the network after trying different ones. 

The **Non-linearity Layers** that we have used are ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Layers, which can be seen as simple range transforms that perform a simple pixel-based mapping that sets the negative values of the image to zero. 

We also introduced **Batch Normalization** layers (normalize the activations of each channel by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation), with the objective of simplifying, speeding up the training and reducing the sensitivity to network initialization. 

The network also contains two **Pooling Layers**, which are in charge of the down-sampling of the image and therefore reducing the number of activations, as well as providing invariance to small local changes. Four our architecture we have chosen to get the maximum values of 2x2 pixel rectangular regions around the input locations (that is, Max-Pooling with stride 2,2). It must be noted that we have just used two of these layers because the original size of our input data was already quite small (28x28 pixel images), so if we wanted a deep network, we could not afford adding pooling layers after each convolutional because we would have lost too much information about precise position of things. 

The **Fully-connected Layers** are the classic layers in which every neuron in the previous layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer and activation is computed as matrix multiplication plus bias. Here, the output of the last convolutional layer is flattened to a single vector which is input to a fully connected layer.

In order to be able to measure the computational complexity of our model, we calculated the total number of parameters of the network, which resulted to be  202.634. We can see that the majority of the parameters come from the fully connected layers, and that the resulting number is quite large. However, we consider that the good performance of this network is worth this computational complexity. 
Hereby is the detailed computation of the total number of parameters. 

![parameters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50060631-630c8d80-0196-11e9-842f-2718396c877b.JPG) 

With the previously defined architecture, after passing to the network mini-batches of test data and comparing their results with the ground truth, we obtained an accuracy on the test set of 89.4%. However, in the training and validation plot of the losses and the accuracy, it could clearly be seen that the network was overfit.

![overfitting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50059060-6b5acd80-0182-11e9-922b-3742113d2218.JPG)

To prevent this overfitting, we decided to implement **loss regularization**, though we could have used many other techniques such as early stopping, dropout, or data augmentation among others. We decided to add the L2 Regularization (or weight decay) to our cross-entropy loss. The L2 penalizes the complexity of the classifier by measuring the number of zeros in the weight vector. 

Using this technique, we were able to obtain an accuracy value on the test set of 91.4%, where although some overfitting occurs, it is not as relevant as before. The results were the following:

![loss accuracy_nooverfit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50059754-2c7d4580-018b-11e9-953b-1b9851d0d444.JPG) 

We must mention that to obtain these results we have used as optimizer the **Adaptive Moments (ADAM)**, which is an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. We also tried to use SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) but it got stuck most of the times in local minimum, giving very poor results.

Additionally, to see how well the network performs on different categories, we created a plot that shows the accuracy for each class. It can be noted that classes that were very similar (wheel and pizza for example) have lower accuracy than the others, while very different and clear objects such as apple, have a very high accuracy.

![acc by class](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43316350/50059736-dad4bb00-018a-11e9-9efe-e7da5539a4ca.JPG) 

Note that in the notebook corresponding to the CNN, some interesting little demos (and in some cases validation steps) can be performed, such as randomly visualizing an image corresponding to the training set of images of the selected class or at the end of the notebook, we can see how the network performs for a random image of the last batch of the test set. An exciting experiment to do is to first try to classify the image by ourselves and then looking to the predicted class and the ground truth value to see if the network performed better than a human...



## 4.3 LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)

The model that we are going to train is an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory Network). We selected this kind of model because we wanted to exploit the temporal information contained in the data.

First of all, we must consider the sizes of the tensors that the network is going to take as input. Our input are variable sized sequences with the format **L x 2**, where L is the length of the sequence, which is variable, and 2 is given by the keypoints in the drawing, which have a range between (0, 0) and (255, 255). We can represent the tensor for each sequence in a drawing:

![just_one_sequence_edited](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29488113/50059015-9395fc80-0181-11e9-8384-e37877491e28.jpg)

If we take a mini-batch of these sequences, we have a set of sequences of different length, as depicted in the following picture.

![batch_without padding_edited](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29488113/50059096-baa0fe00-0182-11e9-9c43-3259137fe03c.jpg)

Unfortunately, PyTorch can't work with batches of variable lengths. One option we could try is **working with a single sequence in each forward pass**, but that **is a bad idea because we will have a very poor gradient estimate and the training time would last forever**.
Luckily, PyTorch provides a solution which helps us feeding **zero-padded** mini-batches to our networks. That means that we will have good gradient estimations, which means shorter training time and better accuracy. Using these solutions, we can use mini-batch optimization algorithms. We pad each sequence with zeros according to the longest sequence length. Thus, we end with a batch of padded sequences that will have the size: **LONGEST_LENGTH x BATCH_SIZE x 2**. Our batches will look like:

![batch_padded_edited](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29488113/50059278-271cfc80-0185-11e9-87f0-e88c1240e109.jpg)

Having explained the input of our network, let us move on to the LSTM networks that we built. 

### LSTM Models

Since we are solving a classification problem, we will need a fully connected layer with softmax activation on top of the LSTM unit **in order to classify the extracted features coming from the LSTM hidden layer**. In this project, we built and trained 3 LSTM models, each one increasing the capacity of the previous one.





# 5. Conclusions

In this project, we have tackled for the first time a Deep Learning problem. We have created self-contained and detailed explainend notebooks, where all the pipeline characteristic of these kind of challenges is implemented **from scratch** (DL settings, data download and manipulation, architecture definition, training steps, validation and testing computation...). Each one of us has addressed the problem with a different approach, studying this way 3 different kinds of deep learning models as a team. We have faced typical deep learning problems such as overfitting, hyperparameter tuning and so on. 

As conclusions, we have found that the model that gives the best performance is the CNN (with an accuracy of 90%), while 



To conclude with, we would like to highlight that we have learned a lot with this project. 

# 6. Future Work

Many different adaptations, tests, and experiments have been left for the future due to lack of time. Followingly, we will briefly define in which directions these future work strands should go:

- **Time Optimization:** Although it has been a very helpful tool, during the implementation of this project, we have wasted a lot of time with Google Colab, due to the fact that execution times are restarted every 12h and then all progress is lost. Additionaly, very often, for unknown reasons the framework suddently disconected and we had to start over (set again the notebook, download the data, restructure it...). If we were to continue with this project, the first thing we would do would be to migrate all the content to Google Cloud Compute Engine. 

- **Challenge Adaptation**: If in the future it was intended to compete in the Kaggle competition (or just to compare the results with the competition's leaderboard - currently with a score of 0.95), many things should be changed. To begin with, the evaluation metrich should be changed to the Mean Average Precision at 3 (which is the one the competition performs) instead of the general accuracy. Furthermore, all the data provided by the competition should be used instead of a reduced version of just 10 of the more than 300 classes available. Moreover, we assume that to obtain competitive results, other models and architectures should also be considered.  

- **Deeper and enhanced analysis of the implemented models:** The Notebooks created could be enhanced by creating better tools to analyse the obtained results such as real-time losses and accuracy plots, computation of a confusion matrix and so on. 

- **Extracted features thorough study:** Deep analysis of how the format of the input data affects the extracted features of each model implementing an encoder/decoder (PONÃ‡).
